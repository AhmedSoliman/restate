## META0010

Trying to open meta storage directory, configured via `meta.storage_path`, which contains incompatible data. This indicates that your data was written with a different Restate version than you are running right now.

Suggestions:

* Up/Downgrade your Restate server to the requested version.
* Migrate your data to the requested version by running the migration scripts.
* Wipe your meta storage directory to start afresh via `--wipe=meta`.
* Configure a different meta storage directory via `meta.storage_path`.
