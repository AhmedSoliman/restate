## RT0008

Trying to open worker storage directory, configured via `worker.stroage_rocksdb.path`, which contains incompatible data. This indicates that your data was written with a different Restate version than you are running right now.

Suggestions:

* Up/Downgrade your Restate server to the requested version.
* Migrate your data to the requested version by running the migration scripts.
* Wipe your worker storage directory to start afresh via `--wipe=worker`.
* Configure a different worker storage directory via `worker.stroage_rocksdb.path`.
